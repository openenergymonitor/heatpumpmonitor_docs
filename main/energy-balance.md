# Overall Energy Balance

  * Introduction (overall operating objectives/control, heat pump operating map, turndown considerations versus diurnal heat loads and seasonality)
  * Heat balance for each zone
    * Environment to Outdoor Unit (evaporator)
    * Outdoor Unit to circulating fluid (compressor, condenser, electrical/mechanical/ thermodynamic losses)
    * Circulating fluid to heated envelope (pump(s) incl. losses, emitters, piping heat losses)
    * Heated envelope to environment (conductive/ventilation losses incl. link to Trystan’s tech paper, MCS methodology incl. shortcomings thereof)
  * Overall performance measures (CoP and SCoP – definition from the foregoing, vendor comparability, relationship to running cost minimisation)
  * Non-steady state operations (compressor start-up/refrigerant warm-up, concept of thermal inertia – circulating fluid warm-up, heated envelope warm-up, DHW heating, defrosting incl. heat source)
  * Explanation of heat pump cycling due to mismatch between instrument hysteresis (LWT and roomstat) and system thermal inertia
