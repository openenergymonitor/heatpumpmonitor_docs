# Heat Pump Basics

- Justification (versus a replacement fossil fuel boiler)

  - Installation costs/grants (outdoor unit, any revised indoor equipment, optional monitoring equipment)

  - Environmental benefits

- Installation options (local/national installer, self-install – link to Glyn’s YouTube videos, reference to HeatGeek)

- Project process

  - Setting design basis (heat pump type/vendor/refrigerant selection, required room temps/timings, specified outdoor temps, circulating fluid selection, need for space cooling in addition to space heating)

- Installer scope (heat loss survey, planning permission, indoor equipment requirements incl. need for backup heater/volumiser/buffer tank and larger DHW tank/emitters, estimate preparation, warranty, project schedule, contract agreement, installation/commissioning, documentation, obtaining grant)

- Hardware monitoring and optimisation
