# Circuit Optimisation

  * Miminising energy consumption
    * Emitter temperature minimisation (heating mode)
    * Setback and TOU tariff programming strategies (incl. space heating/DHW)
    * Effect of defrost cycles (and minimising them)
  * Use of heat pump vendor monitoring equipment
    * Additional data for operation analysis and equipment control
  * Use of OEM monitoring equipment
    * Can contribute to OEM database (useful comparison with other installations, but requires programming/coding)
