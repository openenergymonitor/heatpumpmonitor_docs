## Thermodynamics of a typical Outdoor Unit

  * Use of pressure-enthalpy diagram to illustrate refrigeration cycle
  * Calculation of typical cycle stream properties from instrument data, theoretical analysis, and empirical relationships, at quasi-steady state (space heating/cooling) and non-steady state (DHW heating)
